<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size</name>
  <value>131072</value>
  <description>
    Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
